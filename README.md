# RainbowPhysGun
An addon for Garry's Mod which adds a rainbow effect for physics guns.

## Instructions

To get started, drop this folder into your server's garrysmod/addons folder and head to RainbowPhysGun/lua/rainbows/configuration.lua

In this file you need to set the user groups (Ranks, e.g. vip) that the rainbow effect will be applied to and whether the player color and/or physics gun will change color.

The configuration file contains descriptions on what each part of it is.

Have fun with a more colorful server!
